# Pong
#### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/HraZkfrooVg
#### Description: This final project is inspired by CS50G's first project which is Pong, I recreated the entire game from scratch with a better folder format which gets everything out of main.lua and puts it in other files. Things like sound and constants are all taken from CS50G's own implementation. This project also implements AI and prompts user for the amount of players he wants to have in the game. It includes a fonts folder which includes one font taken from CS50G, a lib folder which loads in the libraries like class.lua, push.lua, a sounds file which houses all of the sounds used in-game like paddle_hit, wall_hit, and score which are all used inside of the game, and a src file which includes classes, dependencies, constants, a state machine library took from CS50G, and a states folder which houses all of the 4 states in this project (not including the base state which every state inherits from) and obviously, main.lua which requires all of the code in the other source files using "require 'src/Dependencies'" and the rest of it is handled by the states and classes
