    Hello, world!
    This is CS50 and this is my Final Project to end it all!
    This project is inspired from CS50G's first project which
    is a recreation of Pong for the Atari 2600 from 1972
    This project's code is re-written in a diffeerent
    folder format where instead of putting all of the
    game states in main.lua, we use a state machine to
    put them all in files like StartState.lua, ServeState.lua, etc.
